This is my game engine, written in C# using the MonoGame Framework. The bulk of the code was written in 2022, however slight changes have been made since then. The engine was written as a learning experience, not for commercial or actual game usage, although it is perfectly usable, though not the most optimised. Currently under a mini revisit to clean up various parts of it, however I consider the features more or less complete to the degree that I wanted them to be.

To use:
(1) Copy all files to a project called Navy
(2) In the same solution, add another project using my template (WIP) and reference the Navy Project
(3) Profit
